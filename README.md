# Traffic_Cone_Detection

Using OpenCV, this code can detect the presence of orange and green traffic cones placed on 2 sides of the road. It can also determine the distance from the cones to the center of camera viewfinder in a real time image. This technique of cone detection can be used in autonomous cars for their accurate navigation.
